# rEngine.js
rEngine.js is a clicker game template, used to make clicker games, I'm not gonna pull some bullshit like "I made Emerald Clicker on this." I didn't. This was just a little side project to maybe help people get started with making a clicker game. It's incredibly barebones, and it doesn't have a save system, don't worry though, you can steal my saving and loading code from emerald clicker.
## Tips
It's important that you...
- Have an html tag
- Have a body tag inside the html tag
- Know some Javascript
